    "how i accidentally violated namecheap's trademark and got my domain taken down"
---

until recently, i made an effort to weave the word "base" into my project names as a fun play on
"basecase". so when i built an ai-powered name generator for startups, it felt obvious to call it
"namebase". i built the project as part of my tradition to
[build with the yc batch](/blog/building-with-the-batch-w24) and launched it on demo day.

the launch was a success. within 24 hours, there had been 11.5k names created, 4.4k site visitors
(from 79 different countries), 350 domains suggested, and 200 logos generated. i got a ton of great
feedback and shipped some more features.

## the incident

a few days after the launch, a user reached out to tell me that the website wasn't loading. i logged
into my namecheap account and discovered that namebase.ai had completely disappeared from my
domains. i reached out to their support team and got a cryptic response back:

```
It has been noticed that fraudulent and misleading content is hosted on the following domain name:

namebase.ai

Please be informed that the domain has been permanently null-routed/placed on Hold and locked due to
a violation of our Universal Terms of Service Agreement. Please refer to paragraph 7. "Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP)" at https://www.namecheap.com/legal/universal/universal-tos.aspx.
```

## the plot thickens

digging deeper into their terms of service, i found something interesting. the policy states that
when a customer violates a trademark, they must:

1. send a takedown notice to the domain owner
2. provide an opportunity to submit a counter-notice

but they didn't take either of these steps. i decided to keep digging. i visited the
[united states patent and trademark office](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search) database to see
if i could find any trademark registrations for "namebase". i discovered something even more
surprising: namecheap owned it themselves. now it was all making sense: they had circumvented their
standard trademark policy when dealing with their own trademark.

## the resolution

i tweeted out a new vercel link to my project, so it could still be accessed, and called it a day.
the next morning, i woke up to a long dm from namecheap's ceo. he explained that he was sorry for
how the incident was handled and that the proper process wasn't followed. he explained that namebase
was an existing business they owned and they needed to protect the trademark, but understood that i
wasn't intentionally trying to violate it. as a gesture of goodwill, he offered me a new domain for
free and restored the original domain while i made the transition.

## the silver lining

now it was time to have some fun. fully recognizing the irony of the situation, i created a fun
launch video using the product to generate a new name (so meta). but i didn't stop there. next, i
shipped a new feature to help userscheck for potential trademark conflicts while generating names,
helping others avoid the same situation i had encountered.

## lessons learned

this incident raised important questions about:

- the power domain registrars have over their customers
- the potential for abuse in trademark enforcement
- the importance of due process in domain disputes
- the need for clear and fair domain takedown procedures

for me, this was a low-stakes situation. i got to make a cheeky launch video, ship a useful new
feature, and even score a free domain out of it. but more importantly, it gave me a tiny glimpse
into the challenges that founders face every day. while my domain incident was just a small bump in
the road, it helped me appreciate the resilience required when founders face similar (and often much
bigger) challenges while building their companies.
