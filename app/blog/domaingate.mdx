    "how i accidentally violated namecheap's trademark and got my domain taken down"
---

until recently, i chose to name all of my side projects with "base" as a fun play on "basecase". so
when i built an ai-powered startup name generator, it was only natural that i call it
[namebase.ai](https://namebase.ai). i built the project as part of my tradition to build with the yc
batch and launched it on demo day.

a surprising turn of events on april 5th, 2024, our domain namebase.ai was suddenly taken down by
namecheap, citing a "trademark violation." what makes this situation particularly interesting is
that namecheap themselves own the trademark in question.

## the incident

without any prior warning or opportunity to respond, our domain was suspended. the first indication
of an issue came when our services became inaccessible, followed by the discovery that namecheap had
taken down the domain citing trademark concerns.

## the plot thickens

upon investigation, we discovered something rather concerning: namecheap owns the trademark
themselves. what's more troubling is that according to their own terms of service, they are required
to:

1. send a takedown notice to the domain owner
2. provide an opportunity to submit a counter-notice

neither of these steps occurred in our case.

## the workaround

for now, we've temporarily relocated our services to:
[namebase.vercel.app](https://namebase.vercel.app)

## the broader implications

this incident raises serious questions about:

- the power domain registrars have over their customers
- the potential for abuse in trademark enforcement
- the importance of due process in domain disputes
- the need for clear and fair domain takedown procedures

## moving forward

we're currently exploring our options and working to resolve this situation. this incident serves as
a reminder of the importance of:

- having backup domain options ready
- understanding your registrar's policies
- maintaining documentation of your domain usage
- being prepared for unexpected service disruptions

we'll continue to update this post as the situation develops.
