    "how i accidentally violated namecheap's trademark and got my domain taken down"
---

until recently, i made an effort to weave the word "base" into my project names as a fun reference
to "basecase". so when i built an ai-powered name generator for startups, i obviously had to call it
"namebase". i built the project as part of my tradition to build something using some of the dev
tools and infra companies from the current yc batch and launched it on demo day.

the launch went well. within 24 hours, the site had generated more than 11,500 startup names, 350
domains, and 200 logos from more than 4,400 unique users around the world. i was pretty excited.

## the incident

a couple of days after the launch, a user reached out to tell me the site was down. i scrambled to
figure out what was wrong. i hadn't made any code changes, so looked to vercel and supabase to see
if i could find anything. after texting back and forth with [@rauchg](https://x.com/rauchg), we
identified it to be a dns issue. i logged into my namecheap account, where i had registered the
domain, to see what was up. to my surprise, namebase.ai had completely disappeared from my list of
active domains. i reached out to their support team and got a cryptic response back (several hours
later):

```text
It has been noticed that fraudulent and misleading content is hosted on the following domain name: namebase.ai

Please be informed that the domain has been permanently null-routed/placed on Hold and locked due to
a violation of our Universal Terms of Service Agreement. Please refer to paragraph 7. "Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP)" at https://www.namecheap.com/legal/universal/universal-tos.aspx.
```

## the plot thickens

digging deeper into their terms of service, i found something interesting. the policy states that
when a customer violates a trademark, namecheap will:

1. send a takedown notice to the domain owner
2. provide an opportunity to submit a counter-notice

but in my case, they didn't. i kept digging. i searched the united states patent and trademark
office (uspto)'s [database](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search) to see if i could find any
relevant trademark registrations. i discovered something even more interesting: namecheap owned the
trademark for "namebase" themselves. now it was all making sense. they had circumvented their
standard trademark policy when dealing with their own trademark.

## the resolution

i tweeted out a new vercel link to my project as a temporary fix and called it a night. the next
morning, i woke up to a long message from namecheap's ceo. he apologized for how the incident was
handled and confirmed that the proper process wasn't followed. he explained that namebase.io was an
existing business they owned and they needed to protect the trademark, but understood that i wasn't
intentionally trying to violate it. as a gesture of goodwill, he offered me a new domain for free
and restored the original domain while i made the transition.

i was genuinely impressed by his response and willingness to make things right. as a domain
registrar, namecheap has a lot of power over the internet. we chatted some more about how they could
improve their processes for handling these situations in the future.

## the fun begins

now it was time to have some fun. fully recognizing the irony of the situation, i created a fun
launch video using the product to generate a new name (very meta, i know). but i didn't stop there.
next, i shipped a new feature to help users check for potential trademark conflicts while generating
names. i integrated with the uspto's trademark database to identify and flag any potential
conflicts.

## lessons learned

this incident raised important questions about the power domain registrars have over their customers
and the need for clear and fair domain takedown procedures. while regulation and oversight are
important, the internet's greatest strength is its ability to empower anyone to build, create, and
share freely. this permissionless innovation has driven incredible progress and enabled countless
ideas to flourish. finding the right balance between protecting intellectual property and preserving
the open spirit of the web is crucial.

the experience also gave me a glimpse into the situations founders face every day. for me, this was
a low-stakes situation. i got to make a cheeky launch video, ship a useful new feature, and even
score a free domain out of it. if this had happened to a founder building a real business, the
impact could have been much more severe. while my domain incident was just a small bump in the road,
it helped me appreciate the resilience required when founders face similar (and often much bigger)
challenges while building their companies.
