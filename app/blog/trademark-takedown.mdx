    "how i accidentally violated namecheap's trademark and got my domain taken down"
---

until recently, i've made an effort to weave the word "base" into my project names as a fun nod to
"basecase". so when i built an ai-powered name generator for startups, it felt obvious to call it
"namebase". i built the project as part of my tradition to
[build with the yc batch](/blog/building-with-the-batch-w24) and launched it on demo day.

the launch was a success. within 24 hours, the site had generated over 11k names, 350 domains, and 200
logos from more than 4k unique users.

## the incident

a few days after the launch, a user reached out to tell me that the website was down. i quickly
identified it do be a dns issue and logged into my namecheap account to see what was up. to my
surprise, namebase.ai had completely disappeared from my domains. i reached out to their support
team and got a cryptic response back (several hours later):

```text
It has been noticed that fraudulent and misleading content is hosted on the following domain name: namebase.ai

Please be informed that the domain has been permanently null-routed/placed on Hold and locked due to
a violation of our Universal Terms of Service Agreement. Please refer to paragraph 7. "Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP)" at https://www.namecheap.com/legal/universal/universal-tos.aspx.
```

## the plot thickens

digging deeper into their terms of service, i found something interesting. the policy stated that
when a customer violates a trademark, namecheap will:

1. send a takedown notice to the domain owner
2. provide an opportunity to submit a counter-notice

but in my case, they didn't take either of these steps. i decided to keep digging. i searched the
united states patent and trademark office's [database](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search) to
see if i could find any relevant trademark registrations. i discovered something even more
interesting: namecheap owned the trademark for "namebase" themselves. now it was all making sense:
they had circumvented their standard trademark policy when dealing with their own trademark.

## the resolution

i tweeted out a new vercel link to my project as a temporary fix and called it a day. the next
morning, i woke up to a long dm from namecheap's ceo. he explained that he was sorry for how the
incident was handled and that the proper process wasn't followed. he explained that namebase.io was
an existing business they owned and they needed to protect the trademark, but understood that i
wasn't intentionally trying to violate it. as a gesture of goodwill, he offered me a new domain for
free and restored the original domain while i made the transition. i was

## the silver lining

now it was time to have some fun. fully recognizing the irony of the situation, i created a fun
launch video using the product to generate a new name (so meta). but i didn't stop there. next, i
shipped a new feature to help userscheck for potential trademark conflicts while generating names,
helping others avoid the same situation i had encountered.

## lessons learned

this incident raised important questions about:

- the power domain registrars have over their customers
- the potential for abuse in trademark enforcement
- the importance of due process in domain disputes
- the need for clear and fair domain takedown procedures

for me, this was a low-stakes situation. i got to make a cheeky launch video, ship a useful new
feature, and even score a free domain out of it. but more importantly, it gave me a tiny glimpse
into the challenges that founders face every day. while my domain incident was just a small bump in
the road, it helped me appreciate the resilience required when founders face similar (and often much
bigger) challenges while building their companies.
